# Master_project_git
My masters project

Diva link will come later.

This repo is intended to host the code and data used for my master project named "Assessing the performance of Random Forest Regression to predict snow depth using Sentinel-1 SAR and field measurements in a sub-arctic alpine region"

It was a 45 credit project at the University of Stockholm.

The code is raw and I will clean the repo slowly and surely.
